# WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO DEVELOPMENT? (April 4th, 2023)

Google. That's what happened. After a [one-sided] battle with playstore policy, LTE Cleaner has been permanently suspended. And as a result, I have given up. On top of the several clones I'm sure you have noticed on the playstore. This project started as a learning project in the 10th grade (2018), and ended up covering my monthly student debt bill from college after I added ads on the playstore variant.

**Why was it suspended?**

This screenshot is appearently the reason. Appearently it "deceives" users.

Without the vital revenue from the playstore varient, the FDroid varient will go unsupported. I do not have time for it anymore without some compensation.

Thank you all for using my app. Never thought I'd hit 100k users on anything I'd make, but I did. Thank you

***The last Android cleaner you will ever need!***

Tired of the abundance of phone cleaners on the play store? Tired of 
them being extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of ads? 
Tired of having to pay? Me too.

There are simply way too many apps out there that claim to speed up your device. In reality, they don't do anything.
LTE Cleaner only aims to clean your phone by removing safe to delete files, which not only frees up a lot of space, but also improve your privacy. Since LTE Cleaner removes .log files, which well, log what you do.

__LTE Cleaner is 100% free, open source, ad free, and deletes everything it claims to.__
